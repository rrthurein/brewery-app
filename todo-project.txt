  Need to add Fermentation Tank input and use this input to define the color of the events
  Key should not exist in a object if there is not value - for example if the FT key value is empty the key in
  the object for FT shouldn't exist or at least when you send it to the event it should not set a event for
  that key.


  Schedule Page -> In this page should have two input, Date and Fermentation Tank Input -> Set Schedule

  When I add the Fermentation Tank number, it should be on a new reference and this reference will set the
  schedule.  





















a beer inventory state that is an array and when it has something in it that's when you render the third page.

- current beer info(state) or an add beer form data; info for the second page where it's added

adding beer state so that it can be click (true/false) the initial state is false

this is what I'm trying to do
this is what I tried and why
this is the unexpected thing that's happening



 when they click schedule, run get schedule and then within get schedule add it to the calendar loop through a list of dates
 within the calculate function call
 onClick import the util function export it from util and import it on plan your brewing excute that function on click
 calculate the schedule get back the list of start time and end time of each of the phases and outside of the function
 and inside the onclick function and loop through all of the result inside onCilck function the result of the calculate function
 can be a list of object that represent each meeting. First object in the array that it returns, and second object in the array
 is the second phase, and use through the array. my add event function main argument will still be the event, this time passing
 in the arguments from the array of  the results from the calculate functions.


 after they  add beer to the list prompt them if they want to edit scheudling parameter
 make it as a separate route where they handle data independly and have all the code on the separate page
 pass the id created from the previous step into the route /id
